VMware Tanzu Application Service NIST
========

This repository contains source files for the https://docs.pivotal.io/nist documentation set.

The VMware Tanzu Application Service (VMware TAs for VMs) NIST topics provide an assessment of TAS for VMs
against the NIST SP 800-53(r4) controls, and provides guidance for how
deployers may achieve compliance when using a shared responsibility model.
Responsibility for any particular control may be assigned to the underlying
IaaS infratructure, the VMware TAs for VMs platform, the deployed application, or the
organization.

This document covers VMware TAS for VMs, and assumes the use of BOSH
and VMware Tanzu Operations Manager. In addition, we assume the platform has been deployed in a
manner consistent with the corresponding IaaS reference architecture.
