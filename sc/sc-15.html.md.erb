##<a id='compliance'></a>VMware Tanzu Application Service Compliance

Compliance with the requirements defined in this control is a deployer responsibility.

Interpretation of the requirement for notification of any remote session initiation in the Tanzu Application Service (TAS for VMs) operational environment might include the start of an SSH session.

When appropriately configured, an operator may know that someone has remotely connected via SSH to a VM or a container.

TAS for VMs provides audit logging for SSH session initiation and the deployer may establish a log alert to satisfy this requirement.
