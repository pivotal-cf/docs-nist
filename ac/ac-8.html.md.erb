##<a id='compliance'></a>Vmware Tanzu Application Service Compliance

Tanzu Application Service (TAS for VMs) is compliant with this requirement. TAS for VMs provides a feature that allows the deployer to configure an organization-defined system use notification message or banner in the VMware Tanzu Operations Manager and Apps Manager UIs. Similarly, configuration of a site-specific banner during SSH sessions into stemcells is available using BOSH add-on.

##<a id='supplemental'></a>Supplemental Guidance

System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners displayed before individuals log in to information systems. System use notifications are used only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist. Organizations consider system use notification messages/banners displayed in multiple languages based on specific organizational needs and the demographics of information system users. Organizations also consult with the Office of the General Counsel for legal review and approval of warning banner content.
