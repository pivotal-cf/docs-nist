##<a id='compliance'></a>PCF Compliance

PCF delegates responsibility for security alerts to the existing enterprise log management system. When appropriately configured, PCF forwards all activity logging to the designated enterprise log management system, and alerts or triggers for specific events may be established there.  All implied requirements for this requirement are satisfied by the PCF platform.

##<a id='supplemental'></a>Supplemental Guidance

The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) generates security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the federal government. Security directives are issued by OMB or other designated organizations with the responsibility and authority to issue such directives. Compliance to security directives is essential due to the critical nature of many of these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the directives not be implemented in a timely manner. External organizations include, for example, external mission/business partners, supply chain partners, external service providers, and other peer/supporting organizations.
