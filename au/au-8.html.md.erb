##<a id='compliance'></a>VMware Tanzu Application Service Compliance

PCF is compliant with this requirement.  The PCF deployment may be configured to use an NTP time server. All VM instances created by BOSH use an NTP client cron job to synchronize time across the machines in the deployment. The PCF deployment includes a "Clock Global" job and deployers may scale the number of instances as needed.

##<a id='description'></a>Control Description

The information system:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Uses internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records; and</li>
  <li>Records time stamps for audit records that can be mapped to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and meets [Assignment: organization-defined granularity of time measurement].</li>
</ol>

##<a id='supplemental'></a>Supplemental Guidance

Time stamps generated by the information system include date and time. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for different system components. Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.
