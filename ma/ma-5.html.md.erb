##<a id='description'></a>Control Description

The organization:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Establishes a process for maintenance personnel authorization and maintains a list of authorized maintenance organizations or personnel;</li>
  <li>Ensures that non-escorted personnel performing maintenance on the information system have required access authorizations; and</li>
  <li>Designates organizational personnel with required access authorizations and technical competence to supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the required access authorizations.</li>
</ol>

##<a id='supplemental'></a>Supplemental Guidance

This control applies to individuals performing hardware or software maintenance on organizational information systems, while PE-2 addresses physical access for individuals whose maintenance duties place them within the physical protection perimeter of the systems (e.g., custodial staff, physical plant maintenance personnel). Technical competence of supervising individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the information systems while having required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the systems. Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel, such as information technology manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators, and consultants, may require privileged access to organizational information systems, for example, when required to conduct maintenance activities with little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk, organizations may issue temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials may be for one-time use or for very limited time periods.
