Compliance with the requirements defined in this control are a deployer responsibility.

The PCF platform provides the organization with a high availability environment, such that an unplanned maintenance event due to hardware or software failure should not result in any application down time.
For example, when supported by the underlying IaaS, the PCF deployment may be operated across multiple availability zones, in order to protect against loss of a specific geographic location.
In the event that spare parts are needed to restore service at a specific geographic location, the applications hosted on PCF should remain available via, e.g., another availability zone.
