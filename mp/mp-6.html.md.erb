##<a id='compliance'></a>VMware Tanzu Application Service Compliance

Compliance with this requirement is the responsibility of the PCF deployer.

The ability to erase residual data on boot, ephemeral, or persistent volumes after they are decommissioned from a PCF deployment inherits from and depends on PCF's underlying infrastructure.

##<a id='description'></a>Control Description

The organization:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Sanitizes [Assignment: organization-defined information system media] prior to disposal, release out of organizational control, or release for reuse using [Assignment: organization-defined sanitization techniques and procedures] in accordance with applicable federal and organizational standards and policies; and</li>
  <li>Employs sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity commensurate with the security category or classification of the information.</li>
</ol>

##<a id='supplemental'></a>Supplemental Guidance

This control applies to all information system media, both digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples include media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, and mobile devices. The sanitization process removes information from the media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes, for example, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections/words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document. NSA standards and policies control the sanitization process for media containing classified information.
