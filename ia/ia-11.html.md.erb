##<a id='compliance'></a>PCF Compliance

This requirement is P0, and not required for FISMA moderate.

Access to all PCF platform functions is via tokens issued from UAA.  Once issued, these tokens enable the user to establish a session at a specific PCF end point interface, 
such as a Web session with Apps Manager, or a CF CLI session from a command prompt.  User session timeouts have default values, and these default values may be overridden by the deployer if and as needed.
Upon session timeout, the user is required to initiate a new session.
