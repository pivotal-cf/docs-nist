##<a id='compliance'></a>VMware Tanzu Application Service Compliance

All `xx-1` requirements are the responsibility of the deployer.
The Tanzu Application Service product feature set is sufficient to satisfy the technical requirements implied in IA-1.
VMware may be able to provide guidance to customers who are creating or updating documentation, but this documentation is unique to the deployer's mission and/or business goals.

##<a id='supplemental'></a>Supplemental Guidance

This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IA family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.
